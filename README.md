# Poly-Wars
I developed a game "Poly Wars" which functioned like an old school arcade game. The user controls the player and the enemies approach the player. The player can emit particles at the enemies to remove them and score points when the player hits an enemy with a particle. If the player collides with an enemy the player loses a health point. If the player loses all their health points, the game is over. The game contains slider which can set certain aspects of the game such as the number of enemies and the total number of health points for the player. The game also contains sounds as well as visuals that I drew.
